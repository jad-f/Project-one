# Reflection on Project: Tool Wear Prediction for CNC Machining

This project is the first project that show me to data analysis and machine learning using Python for the first time.  
As a mechanical engineer, my main goal was to apply data-driven methods to study tool wear in CNC machining, which is directly related to my PhD research on hybrid manufacturing optimisation.

The first challenge was understanding how to organise the project and run code locally in Visual Studio Code. I learned how to use Jupyter notebooks, manage folders, and run Python scripts for data analysis. Using libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn, I was able to combine data from multiple experiments, clean it, and create visualisations such as the correlation heatmap and PCA plots.

Building and testing the clustering and predictive model helped me see how different parameters—feed rate, clamp pressure, and motor current—relate to tool wear. I also understood how dataset size affects performance and how reducing experiments simplifies learning but limits accuracy.

This project gave me confidence in using Python for engineering research and taught me how to document and share code reproducibly using GitHub. In future work, I plan to expand the dataset and include time-series models to predict wear progression.
